# To avoid missing sources for the driver for a specific kernel version
# we have to set BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL_MIN and BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL_MAX to build only driver
# only between these Kernel versions.
# This means the driver will not fail for Kernels that are not present outside of these versions.
# For the moment: #MOD_MIN_VER# to #MOD_MAX_VER# are present.

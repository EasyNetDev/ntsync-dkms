# NTSYNC DKMS driver
NT synchronization primitive emulation

This module provides kernel support for emulation of Windows NT
synchronization primitives. It is not a hardware driver.

This driver is a debianization of the Kernel driver for Debian/Ubuntu OS
which doesn't provide yet the driver in original Kernel packages.
